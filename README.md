# reactjs-journey 👩🏼‍💻

Welcome to my notes on my journey learning React JS!
This repository is used for my note-taking, practice, exercises, and projects focused on ReactJS courses, and resources.

## What is React JS? 🤓

React JS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by a community of developers. React allows you to create reusable components that can be rendered on the server or the client, making it a great choice for building scalable and performant web applications.

## Why I'm learning React 📕

I'm learning React because I want to improve my skills as a front-end developer and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. React is widely used in the industry and learning it will allow me to build modern web applications that are fast and interactive.

## Resources I'm using 🗞️

I'm using a combination of online resources to learn React, including:

1. [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/dashboard#overview) - A platform for interactive coding screencasts that allows you to follow along with the instructor and write code in your own browser.
2. [React documentation](https://beta.reactjs.org) - The official React documentation is a great resource for learning the basics and diving deeper into specific topics.
3. [React tutorials on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=react+tutorials) - There are many great React tutorials available on YouTube that provide a visual explanation of different concepts.

## My progress so far 🪜

So far, I have completed the following courses and tutorials:

1. [Intro to React on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)
2. [React for Beginners on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPT3bFIwJYA)

I have also built a few small projects to practice my skills, including a [weather app](https://github.com/AshM10/react-weather-app) , a [dictionary app](https://github.com/AshM10/react-dictionary-project) and [100 ways to digital detox app](https://github.com/AshM10/digital-detox) . I also worked with other developers, and used React to build a [to-do list app](https://github.com/explorerdevs/fm-todoist) and a [memory game app](https://github.com/explorerdevs/memory-game) . I joined a hackathon where we made the [Happy Garden app](https://github.com/elsalvadordali/green-smile) that won third place. 

## Future plans 🔭

In the future, I plan to continue learning and improving my React skills by building more projects and possibly taking more advanced courses. I'm also interested in learning about other related technologies, such as Redux and GraphQL.
