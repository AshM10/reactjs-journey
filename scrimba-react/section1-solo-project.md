## Asking for code review

Hello everyone!

I've just completed my first solo Scrimba project using React, a digital business card for Ash Moreno. It's a simple card that displays information about Ash Moreno, including their background and interests, as well as links to their social media profiles.

I would greatly appreciate it if some of you could take a look at my code and give me some feedback. I'm particularly interested in hearing about:

- readability of the code
- best practices used
- efficiency
- areas for improvement
- any error that you might find

Thank you in advance for your time and feedback!

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create custom components and use JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript, to describe the structure and content of a component. React also allows for easy styling of components using CSS classes. Additionally, React can be used to create static pages for faster loading and improved SEO.
