# React's Tree Rendering

- we need to understand how react renders the component that it renders:

1. React recursively renders components down one branch until there are no more to render

  - We have the ` App ` component that's rendering a ` p ` and two ` GrandParent ` components

```js
import React, {Component} from "react"
import Child from "./Child"

class Parent extends Component {
    render() {
        console.log("[ ]   [üë©üèº‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è]   [ ]   [ ] rendered")
        return (
            <div>
                <p>I'm a Parent Component</p>
                <Child />
                <Child />
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default Parent
```

  - ` GrandParent ` is rendering a ` p ` and two ` parent ` components

```js
import React, {Component} from "react"
import Parent from "./Parent"

class GrandParent extends Component {
    render() {
        console.log("[üë¥üèº]   [ ]   [ ]   [ ] rendered")
        return (
            <div>
                <p>I'm a GrandParent Component</p>
                <Parent />
                <Parent />
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default GrandParent
```

  - the ` parent ` is rendering a ` p ` and two ` child ` components

```js
import React, {Component} from "react"
import Child from "./Child"

class Parent extends Component {
    render() {
        console.log("[ ]   [üë©üèº‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è]   [ ]   [ ] rendered")
        return (
            <div>
                <p>I'm a Parent Component</p>
                <Child />
                <Child />
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default Parent
```

  - and the ` child ` is rendering a ` p ` and two ` GrandChild ` components

```js
import React, {Component} from "react"
import GrandChild from "./GrandChild"

class Child extends Component {
    render() {
        console.log("[ ]   [ ]   [üßíüèª]   [ ] rendered")
        return (
            <div>
                <p>I'm a Child Component</p>
                <GrandChild />
                <GrandChild />
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default Child
```

- the point of this is just to create a strong hierarchy and see that as we get lower and lower there's gonna be a lot more instances of 
` GrandChild ` than it will ever be of ` Parents ` , there should be 16 of the ` GrandChild ` components.

2. Changes to state or props in any component will recursively re-render down the remaining tree whether those components have changed or not.

- this is one of the key features of React, as it allows the framework to efficiently update the UI in response to changes in the component state.

- However, if a component is re-rendered unnecessarily, it can have a negative impact on the performance of an application. If a component is re-rendered unnecessarily, it can cause the browser to do more work than is necessary to update the UI, which can lead to slower rendering times and a less responsive user experience.

3. ` shouldComponentUpdate() ` method, ` React.PureComponent ` , and ` React.memo() ` are tools to help fix this problem. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

- There are a few ways to optimize the rendering performance of a React application. One approach is to use React's shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method, which allows a component to return a boolean value indicating whether it should re-render or not. By carefully controlling when a component re-renders, it's possible to improve the overall performance of an application.

- Another approach is to use React's memo higher-order component, which is similar to shouldComponentUpdate, but is applied as a function that wraps a component rather than a method on the component itself. memo will only re-render a component if its props have changed, which can help to optimize the performance of an application by minimizing unnecessary re-renders.

- Finally, it's also important to consider the overall design of an application and to make sure that the component tree is structured in a way that minimizes the number of unnecessary re-renders. This might involve using techniques like lifting state up and using a unidirectional data flow to ensure that changes to state only affect the components that need to be updated.

## Summary

- In React, the term "tree rendering" refers to the way that the React framework constructs and updates the user interface (UI) of an application.

- React uses a virtual DOM (a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM) to render and update the UI of an application. When the state of a component changes, React will first create a new virtual DOM representation of the updated component. It will then compare this new virtual DOM representation to the previous one using a diffing algorithm, which determines the minimum number of DOM operations needed to update the actual DOM to match the new virtual DOM.

- This process is known as "tree rendering" because the virtual DOM can be thought of as a tree structure, with the root node representing the top-level component and each branch representing a nested component. When a component's state changes, React will update the virtual DOM tree by adding, removing, or modifying the nodes that represent that component and its descendants.

- Tree rendering is an important aspect of React's design because it allows the framework to efficiently update the UI in response to changes in the component state, without having to rebuild the entire UI from scratch each time. This makes it possible to build fast, responsive user interfaces that can handle frequent updates and updates.
